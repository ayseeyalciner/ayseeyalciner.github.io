    <h1>History of AI</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Aspirations, fears, and fantasies about intelligent machines that perform various servile functions is as older as the history of humankind.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>3000 years ago, before the first mention of the term «robot» is made by Karel Capek, Homer introduced Hephaestus, the Greek god of smithing and craft, whose golden handmaidens, endowed with characteristics of movement, perception, judgment, and speech, assist him in his work.</li>
        <li>Given the prevalence of intelligent artificial objects in Hellenic culture, it is no surprise that engineers in the later periods turned to designing and building these machines.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Around the year 1495, Leonardo Da Vinci drew an artificial man in the form of an armored knight powered by an external mechanical crank.</li>

        <li>In 1929, Makoto Nishimura, a Japanese professor of marine biology at the Hokkaido Imperial University, built the first robot named Gakutensoku.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>In 1950, Alan Turing published his famous work «Computer Machinery and Intelligence» in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence. However, the pursuit wasn’t possible back then due to computational limitations.</li>
        <li>Five years later, The Logic Theorists, the first computer program designed to mimic the problem-solving skills of a human, was invented and presented at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence hosted by John McCarthy. This was the first usage of the term.</li>
        <li>Throughout the following years, AI flourished as computers could store more information and became faster, cheaper, and more accessible. And now, we live in an age where AI is transforming many industrial and scientific fields.</li>
